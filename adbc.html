<h2>Black ceomdey</h2>

    <p>Now that weve discussed the most popular genre you should probably also know the least popular film genre.The least popular film genre is black comedy.Now I think its grown in recent years, however my data is based of the past 26 years. In the past 26 years its only made 2.12 Billion dollars in the U.S and Canada. Now i personally enjoy black comedy so it confuses me. But then again everyone has their opinions. Besides one of the genres had to be least popular. Doesn't mean its not popular!!!</p>

  <h3>What is black comedy?</h3>
  <p>Black comedy, also known as black humor, dark humor, dark comedy, morbid humor, or gallows humor, is a style of comedy that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo, particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss. Writers and comedians often use it as a tool for exploring vulgar issues by provoking discomfort, serious thought, and amusement for their audience. Thus, in fiction, for example, the term black comedy can also refer to a genre in which dark humor is a core component.Popular themes of the genre include death, crime, poverty, suicide, war, violence, terrorism, discrimination, disease, racism, sexism, and human sexuality.</p>
