    What are movies and how did they come to be?
    </h1>
    <p>A movie or otherwise known as Cinematography is the illusion of movement by the recording and subsequent rapid projection of many still photographic pictures on a screen. Movies have become a center focus of mass entertainment and communication in our modern society, and today it is a multi-billion-pound industry.Movies werent invented by one single person, However, in 1891 the Edison Company successfully demonstrated a prototype of the Kinetoscope, which enabled one person at a time to view moving pictures.The first to project moving pictures to a paying audience were the Lumière brothers in December 1895 in Paris, France. They used a device of their own making, the Cinématographe, which was a camera, a projector and a film printer all in one.</p>
