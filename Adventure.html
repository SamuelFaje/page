<h3>What are adventure Movies?</h3>
<p>As you might've already seen up above an adventure film is defined by the jouney taken in the film which usually takes place in a fantasy world.Subgenres of adventure films include swashbuckler films, pirate films, and survival films. Adventure films may also be combined with other film genres such as action, animation, comedy, drama, fantasy, science fiction, family, horror, or war.Setting plays an important role in an adventure film, sometimes itself acting as a character in the narrative. They are typically set in far away lands, such as lost continents or other exotic locations. They may also be set in a period background and may include adapted stories of historical or fictional adventure heroes within the historical context. Such struggles and situations that confront the main characters include things like battles, piracy, rebellion, and the creation of empires and kingdoms. A common theme of adventure films is of characters leaving their home or place of comfort and going to fulfill a goal, embarking on travels, quests, treasure hunts, heroic journeys; and explorations or searches for the unknown.</p>

  <h4>Why are adventure movies the most popular Genre?</h4>

<p>Now we know that adventure movies are the most popular film genre, but why is that? Throughout the year 1995 to 2021 Adventure movies have made 64 Billion dollars in just the U.S and Canada. I think adventure films attract so many people because we like the sense of entering a new world away from all the problems in this world. Because some people may not like the life they live. We think of it as a getaway from the real world.</p>
